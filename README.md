### Clue Android Assignment
The purpose of this assignment is to evaluate your coding performance and to understand your working process.

#### Task
We want you to design,
- An App using a random image UnSplash API (included in the project).
- On click of a button, it should fetch a new image and append in the list.
- The data should persist across sessions.

Don't worry too much about how the list will looks for now. Feel free to adjust
the layout as you see fit.


#### Implementation Details.
Use the API, `photos/random/` from the Unsplash API that will let you fetch a random photo.

#### Expectations
- A consistent and well defined app architecture.
It does NOT need to be a specific architecture but it needs to be applied consistently.
- Production level code.
No commented out code, no crashes, broken UI, etc.
- Written in Kotlin
- Provide a README describing architectural decisions you made, any libraries used, and anything else you would like to highlight as a part of your solution.
