## Clue Android Assignment
The purpose of this assignment is to get a sense of your technical skills and how you apply them.

### Task
The assignment is to develop an image fetching application using the UnSplash API. This application should enable the users to add a random image to a list, that is persisted across sessions.

#### Submission
Once you arrive to a solution that you're comfortable with, please submit a pull request.

#### API documentation
The UnSplash API requires a key. It can be obtained through this [url](https://unsplash.com/documentation#creating-a-developer-account) by creating a developer account.

The full documentation of the API can be found [here](https://unsplash.com/documentation).
The random image endpoint documentation can also be found [here](https://unsplash.com/documentation#get-a-random-photo)

#### Requirements

- On first start, the user sees a single image in a list coming from the API.
- When the user clicks a button, a new random image from the API is appended to the list.
- When the user taps on an image, the image details (description, location, number of likes etc.) are displayed (It's up to you to decide how, where and how many of these details you want to show).
- When the app is reopened, the list from the previous session is displayed.

#### Sample Screen
Feel free to come up with the best UI that fulfills the requirements, you can use the image below as inspiration.

#### Expectations

- All the functional requirements are met by the application.
- A consistent and well defined app architecture is used, with a clear separation of concerns.
- Production level code.
- Written in Kotlin.
- [Optional] Provide a README with anything you would like to highlight as a part of your solution.

This repository is providing a base implementation, but don’t feel obligated to follow it, if it doesn’t align with your solution. Feel free to use any library or pattern you think is suitable for the project.

Feel free to send us emails if you have any question.

We look forward to seeing what you come up with, have fun!
